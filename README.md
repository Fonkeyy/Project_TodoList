# Project_TodoList

## Project Overview
The design is 100% inspired by [Todo](https://todoist.com/)

## üöÄ Learning Highlights
- **Class**: It was the opportunity to make use of the Class syntax.
- **IIFE** : I've implemented "Immediately Invoked Function Expression" which led me to be more familiar with this concept.
- **LocalStorage** : First use of local storage. 
- **Integration** : It has been a good exercice to implement an existing design.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features
- **Project**: Create new project folder to store your todos.
- **Todo**: Create a new todo, choose it's name, add a description or a comment, select a project folder, due date and between 4 levels of priority. When it's done, just check the box then the todo goes automatically in the archive folder.
- **Edit**: Modify the todo's informations easily with just clicking on the info you want to change.
- **Delete** : Delete projects and todos when they are no longer needed.
- **Storage** : Storage persistence, your data is saved locally so you can close the app or refresh your data will be there.
